  <h3>Theme</h3>
  <p>
    This year's theme is "Inclusion and Creativity", and we are opening up the hackathon to any and all projects,
    security related or not.
    All project submissions will receive points from judging, and have a chance to win first, second, or third place
    prizes.
    For those that are looking for an edge against the competition, bonus points will be awarded to projects that are
    designed with the "Cloud"
    in mind, and that utilize FireEye products via API. To learn more about judging, see the Judging section below. Come
    and build something fun, cool, and innovative with your
    friends and coworkers!
  </p>

  <h3>Dates</h3>
  <p>
    The registration process will be open from January 17th, 8:00 AM EST to February 7th, 11:59 PM EST. The registration
    portal will
    remain accessible after registration closes so participants can continue to form teams right up to the event, but no
    new participants will be allowed to register. This is because the hackathon team needs an accurate list of
    participants
    and their profiles to coordinate with onsite volunteers and purchase swag, hardware, software, and food.

    The hackathon starts on March 30th at 8:00 AM EST and will end on 11:59 PM on March 31st. You can work as much or
    as little as you want during that time frame, including through the evenings and nights if you wanted to! This gives
    you 40 hours to work on your project and provide your submission before the deadline!

    Dates and times for the judging process can be found in the "Judging" section of this page.
  </p>

  <h3>Prizes</h3>
  <p>
    You asked and we listened. The prizes for hackathon 2020 have greatly increased in both value and quality, with a
    total prize pool
    this year of $28,000 USD! There will also be a prize pool dedicated to remote employees that participate in the
    hackathon!
    Also, instead of picking the prizes for you this year we've decided that it would be best to let you pick the
    prizes!
    After all, nobody knows you better than yourself! Here is a breakdown of the prizes:
    <ul>
      <li>1st: Spark Points - Skyrocket ($10,000 USD total)</li>
      <li>2nd: Spark Points - Electrify & Burst ($6,000 USD total)</li>
      <li>3rd: Spark Points - (4x) Burst ($4,000 USD total)</li>
      <li>Day-of Prizes: 64-count, $125 USD Amazon gift cards</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Day of Services</h3>
  <p>
    We didn't stop listening! This year we will also be including day-of services for those participating at FireEye
    offices!
    For those of you who are remote, don't worry, you will be able to expense $60 USD/day in meals for your
    participation! Be sure to use assign the expense to "HACK-A-THON" (3801) when creating your expense report.
    We will be announcing these services closer to the event, so keep an eye out for an update from the internal comms
    team!
  </p>

  <h3>Participation</h3>
  <p>
    We want to encourage as many employees as possible, regardless of technical ability, to participate in this year's
    hackathon
    to strengthen relationships, foster creativity, and learn new things. This will be a safe place to experiment with
    any
    ideas you may have, be they FireEye related or not, with free food, prizes, and other goodies to keep things
    engaging.
    While software engineering is a usually a core part of every hackathon, there are opportunities to participate this
    year
    outside of writing code.
    <ul>
      <li>Teams will need to effectively advocate their ideas to judges, so participants with video, marketing, sales,
        and
        public speaking experience can improve the chances of winning.</li>
      <li>We will need volunteers to help coordinate and run the hackathon both on-site and remotely.</li>
      <li>We are looking for project sponsors in every department to pitch innovative ideas for hackathon
        participants to work on.
        Also, if you have an idea but you don't know how to build it, this is a perfect way to join in!</li>
    </ul>
    If you are interested in volunteering, please email <a href="mailto:hackathon@fireeye.com">hackathon@fireeye.com</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Project Submission Process</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill out the project submission form <a
          href="https://airtable.com/shrQKUV9pObv9QWaZ">(https://airtable.com/shrQKUV9pObv9QWaZ)</a> by 11:59:59 PM EST,
        March 31st.</li>
      <li>The submission must include a video no longer than 1 minute, along with a zipped copy of all project files.
        You will not be able to submit new files after this deadline.
      </li>
      <li>Since our judges and teams are distributed globally, this video will be what the judges use to determine the
        top five projects during their normal working hours. Other project files may be used during the juging process
        to determine the top three winners.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Judging</h3>
  <p>
    Projects will be judged on the following criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>LEVEL OF INNOVATION</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology can be cool but not innovative—and vice versa. Apart from coolness, “level of innovation” is
            our take on participants’
            awareness of other attempts to solve the same problem they are, and how the team positions their hackathon
            entry.
            Does it pull something off that hasn’t been pulled off before? Does it do something new and unique?</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>REALISTIC CAPABILITY</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The two days we set aside for our teams to pause their normal course of work go by fast. Which teams built
            working solutions?
            Which bit off a little more than they could chew? What gets done in the space of a hackathon is a decent
            indication of
            the dependencies and level of effort that would be required to put the technology into production. This
            category is our
            way of quantifying that.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>COOLNESS</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>“Coolness” is an attempt to measure the important “wow” factor: the impression the hackathon entry makes
            when you see it,
            and the gestalt of the demo. Is it a reflection of a diverse team’s ingenuity? Is it something a human being
            would feel delighted,
            excited, empowered, or even relieved to use.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    All projects starts with a multiplier of 1.0x and, while we encourage any and all project ideas, this year's
    hackathon will award small bonus multipliers to the final score of projects that adhere to the following criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>+0.1x points for projects that have a “for the cloud” aspect – e.g. protects cloud workloads or other customer
        activity in the cloud</li>
      <li>+0.1x points for projects that use one or more FireEye products via API (DoD, Innovation Architecture,
        HX/Helix
        API, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    Judging will happen in two rounds:
    <ul>
      <li>Round one judging will incorporate <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel">Gavel</a>, a pairwise
        judging
        algorithm
        developed by MIT for their hackathon.
        Judges will use video submissions and project files to determine the best projects based on the above criteria.
        Bonus points will be added after round one judging is complete. The final score will determine the top 5
        projects,
        which will move on to round two.</li>
      <li>Round two finalists will have one week (April 6th-10th) to prepare a 5 minute presentation followed by 5
        minutes
        of
        questions for a panel of judges. Finalist round will take place on Monday, April 13th, with winners announced
        that
        same day.
        In the event of a tie, Grady Summers will decide the winner.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
  <p>
    Q: Does my hackathon project have to be code-related, or can I work on anything that may be innovative to how we do
    things today?
    </br>
    A: Projects in no way are required to be code-related. Do you have a new way we could market our products or an
    efficient, new way of operating? Come spend this time working on those and pitch them during your submission! You
    can come to the hackathon and innovate in any way that you’d like!
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: Will you be providing training for FireEye products before the hackathon?
    </br>
    A: We will be working with the product teams to create a 1-hour crash-course on how to use the APIs for their
    products. Please note that the product teams we reach out to will be based on the FireEye products requested in your
    profile. The training will be announced after registration closes and we can coordinate with the product teams to
    provide the crash course. Please keep an eye out for an email from the hackathon team!
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: What is the theme & focus for this year’s hackathon?
    </br>
    A: This year you can build whatever you want. You can build something related to FireEye products but you are in no
    way required to—so that cooking baking app you’ve always wanted to build with your coworker? Go for it! That said,
    as stated in the About section of the Hackathon Registration Portal, bonus multipliers will be awarded to those who
    work with FireEye product APIs or have major cloud aspects. Please, read the About section for specifics on judging
    and multipliers.
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: I would like to volunteer for the hackathon, how can I get started?

    </br>
    </br>
    Q: Is there any required team composition this year?
    </br>
    A: We are not requiring any particular team composition this year. That said, we highly encourage you to have a
    diverse team as you will be pitching your team to the judges and marketing, sales, and some soft skills can be just
    as important as anything you may have built.
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: What is the actual time that the hackathon starts and ends?
    </br>
    A: The hackathon starts on March 30th at 8:00 AM EST and will end on 11:59 PM on March 31st. You can work as much or
    as little as you want during that time frame, including through the evenings and nights if you wanted to! This gives
    you 40 hours to work on your project and provide your submission before the deadline!
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: Are interns able to participate in the hackathon?
    </br>
    A: The hackathon team has no issues with participation from interns, we leave that up to their managers to allow
    them the time to participate!
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: We would like to have a team size that is slightly larger than the allowed team size—can we add additional
    members to our team?
    </br>
    A: We have heard your requests and we have decided to increase the maximum team size from 6 members to 8 members.
    That said, the maximum team size is final and will not change again.
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: Do I have to pick a team before registration closes?
    </br>
    A: As long as you register before registration closing you may access this portal at any time to change teams.
    </br>
    </br>
    Q: Can I update my profile after registration ends?
    </br>
    A: While you will be able to login to the portal at anytime during and after registration, the profile page will be
    disabled.  This is because the Hackathon team needs accurate information for puchasing swag and food.  If you have
    a last minute change, please email hackathon@fireeye.com and we will try to accomodate you.
