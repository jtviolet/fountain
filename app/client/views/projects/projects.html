        <strong>
          Description
        </strong> :
        By using XAPerf (internal tool) we can take snapshots of the endpoint data. This could be used to build out
        charts and trends on endpoint data.

        <strong>
          Benefits
        </strong> :
        Customer's IT group consistently blames Endpoint Security as the offending app, where the SOC has to prove the
        agent was not the cause of a performance hit at a specific point of time.

        Endpoint Console is in need of charts to show more insightful data to the analysts. Types of alerts, agent
        versions deployed, scan reports, etc… are all generated by hand through CSV downloads.

        <strong>
          Description
        </strong> :
        Consulting creates a lot of new scripts to be used by the agent, but the Endpoint Console cannot dynamically
        display these results as the Audit Viewer is hardcoded per audit type. Having a way to generically populate new
        audit data could be used as a module for all Mandiant/Manage Defense scripts. These scripts are finding the
        latest ways threat actors are evading detection.

        <strong>
          Benefits
        </strong> :
        Customers will immediately receive scripts as they are vetted by Consulting versus having to wait for several
        months to years before engineering finds available cycles to add it in.

          Description

        Consulting created a feature called Storytime and will be used for the FireEye platform in a year or so. It will
        make its first appearance in Endpoint Security. Having it modernized to the MUSE fabric and adding any FireEye
        decorators will help speed up its release. This is the "WOW" factor when showing off your technology to
        prospective clients.

        Major increase in sale opportunities for Small and Medium business that do not have an experienced analysts to
        decipher and analyze the data. This visualization makes it much easier to understand what has occurred and the

        <strong>
          Description
        </strong> :
        Customers ask for mobile support. The first pathway to manage a mobile device through Endpoint Security is to
        make a forensics feature on Android or iOS. Sluethkit is used by Endpoint Security today and could be extended
        to the mobile device too.

        <strong>
          Benefits
        </strong> :
        Addresses a gap in mobile visibility while doing an investigation. Customers ask for protection, but Google and
        Apple do this fairly well with their app markets. An MDM will handle side loaded apps, so a gap to cover here is
        forensics, which a customer will be willing to install with their MDM solution.

        contain or respond to a threat inside of a container, docker, kubernettes, etc… environment will help leap over
        our vendors who only offer detection capabilities.

        stopping further attacks. This will expand our footprint in the Linux space.

        Endpoint Console stores events and alerts on a Kafka message bus. Today, Helix and SIEMs have to poll for data
        every 10 to 30 minutes. Customers want the data in real-time, so a push mechanism would be needed.

      Exploit Detection Validation by Verodin

        could be done by a module and point to a Verodin server for the results.
      </div>

    <div class="item">
      <div class="content">
        <strong>
          Benefits
        </strong> :
        Doing this check will have immense benefits. You can do this for a POV (Proof of Value) as the prospect can see
        alert data generated by the agent. We can use this for Support, to make sure the agent is reporting alerts
        according to features enabled. Customers can validate the agent is running as expected for a weekly report. This
        also enables more Verodin sales because now Verodin could be extended as part of an Endpoint subscription. It
        can also get customers to switch from their legacy AV, if they consistently see Verodin bypassing their security
        where Endpoint Security is only enabled for the EDR side.

    <div class="item">
      <div class="content">
        <strong>
          Benefits
        </strong> :
        FORCE, Support, Manage Defense and Intel get an abundance of requests on Endpoint detection capabilities, where
        it is very difficult to determine without research. Having a MITRE map on the console can help customers
        understand what current detections they have already triggered upon (red) and possibly have a content feed to
        see what detections we support (green). This limits the confusion and shows our strength in MITRE.

        Many companies have multiple AV's running, so having a 10,000 foot view on which AV's are working vs not, such
        as FireEye finding a ton of threats the AV missed. Helps enable an AV replacement for FireEye to take over. Also
        it will feed our telemetry so we can study which AV's are being bypassed for better protection opportunities and
        to consider automatic best practices for stronger security controls if we know that AV is installed.
